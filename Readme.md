# Dataset labeling

## TODO
-  Hide boxes

## Start the annotation service using docker

Specify the following environment variables:
- IMAGES_PATH the folder containing the images to label
- HUMAN_ANNOTATIONS_PATH the folder to store the (future) human annotations
- MODEL_ANNOTATIONS_PATH optional, the folder containing pre-annotations (typically, generated by a model, for humans to check and correct).
- CLASS_NAMES a non-empty list of class names (can be just one class).
- CLASS_COLORS optional, sets the color of each class' bounding box. Must be of the same length as CLASS_NAMES .

Then start the server with `docker-compose up`. It will build the docker image if needed. For instance, for testing purposes:
```bash
export IMAGES_PATH=$(pwd)/assets/images
export HUMAN_ANNOTATIONS_PATH=$(pwd)/assets/human_annotations
export MODEL_ANNOTATIONS_PATH=$(pwd)/assets/model_annotations
export CLASS_NAMES=truck,red,orange,black
export CLASS_COLORS=#e5ff00,#ff0000,#ff7f00,#000000

mkdir -p $HUMAN_ANNOTATIONS_PATH # otherwise it would be created by docker/root and be unwritable
docker-compose up
```

You may define those env variable in the file `.env`, which is read by docker-compose. See `sample.env` for an example.

Please note that a file "class_names.txt" will be created in MODEL_ANNOTATIONS_PATH with the list of the class names. This file is useful for the next step: generating the tfrecord files.

## Start the annotation service without docker
If everything is installed on your host computer, you can start the annotation service by running:

```bash
python3 app.py --images_path= \
               --human_annotations_path= \
               --model_annotations_path=
```

the images need to be in the `static/` folder to be served with flask

## Check the annotations
The annotation server can be hacked to check the annotations:
- copy the human annotations to the model preannotations folder
- launch a new server (different name and port) with docker-compose_check-annotation.yml .


## Optional: preannotate images with a frozen model
Run `cd tools/machine_annotation &&  python3 app.py` . This script can be run from a docker container built with `tools/machine_annotation/(cpu/gpu)-Dockerfile` .

## Optional : extract frame from a video
Run `cd tools && python3 burst_video.py`

To know the different options you can use, you can use the '--help' argument. You can provide these option using the command line, environment variables or by populate the `config_video_bust.yml` file created the first time you run the script

## Contributing: code architecture
- app.py contains the Flask backend code
- front/src/App.vue contains the frontend template. To draw the rectangles on an image, it uses the custom `rectangle` component, defined below.
- front/src/components/Rectangle.vue defines the `rectangle` component.
